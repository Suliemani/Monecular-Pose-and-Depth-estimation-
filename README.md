# Monecular-Pose-and-Depth-estimation-
Monocular pose classification and depth estimation are explored using deep learning on single RGB images. Custom CNNs and pretrained models are evaluated under challenging visual conditions such as blur and noise. Results show that lightweight and selectively fine-tuned architectures achieve accurate pose recognition and reliable depth prediction.
